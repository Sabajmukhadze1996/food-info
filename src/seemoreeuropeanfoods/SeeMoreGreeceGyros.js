        Grilling a vertical spit of stacked meat and slicing it off as it cooks 
        was developed in Bursa[7] in the 19th century in the Ottoman Empire, and 
        called doner kebab (Turkish: d√∂ner kebap). Following World War II, doner 
        kebab made with lamb was present in Athens,[8][7] introduced by 
        immigrants from Anatolia and the Middle East,[6] possibly with the 
        population exchange between Greece and Turkey.[9] A distinct Greek 
        variation developed, normally made with pork and served with tzatziki, 
        which later became known as gyros.[10]
        By 1970, gyros wrapped sandwiches were already a popular fast food in 
        Athens, as well as in Chicago and New York City.[11][12][13] At that 
        time, although vertical rotisseries were starting to be mass-produced 
        in the US by Gyros Inc.[11] of Chicago, the stacks of meat were still 
        hand-made. There are several claimants to have introduced the first mass 
        produced gyros to the United States.
